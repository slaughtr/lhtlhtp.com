So there you are, relaxing in a calm, sunny meadow. You gently curl back the title page of your favorite Sabrina the Teenage Witch fanfiction novel to come across this: ```<!DOCTYPE html>```

What's this? Someone sold you "Sabrina XVI" in the wrong language. Lucky for you, HTML is the language you'd want to see if you're a student at Epicodus, as it is the basic structure of our story. Let's get into the vitals:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
<head>
  <title>Sabrina XVI: Lost In Time</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h3>Chapter 1: Oops! He did it again!</h3>
  <p>Salem leaped down from the refridgerator to offer some wise advice: 'Harvey is only a human. Give him another chance.'</p>
  <p>Another chance? What did he do this time? This is only the second paragraph of our story, as indicated from the "p" tags that surround this.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

The majority of the time, the starting content of your HTML document is going to look a little like this. For a review of what each thing is, check out [this](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/git-html-and-css/hypertext-markup-language-html).

Pro tip: If you're just starting an HTML document (ie: index.html), you can type "!" and press "enter" and it should give you a template very similar to the one on LHTP.com.

Take note of the indentation, as this is something they'll be looking at throughout your time at epicodus. And they aren't being sticklers about it: this makes your code easier to read and is a best-of-the-best practice for coders all across the 9142 galaxies or whatever.

Your code should follow a format like this:

```html
...
<body>
  <h3>This is inside the body so it's indented.</h3>
  <div class="example">
    <h3>Content inside something else gets indented.</h3>
    <p>Cats and boots and cats and boots and...</p>
  </div> 
  <h3>Now that div indentation ended because the /tag closed it</h3>
</body>
...
```
