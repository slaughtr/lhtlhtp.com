## This page needs a lot of love

As this page is being written we, the authors behind {{ lhtlhtp() }}, are in
week 12 of the 20 week boot camp at Epicodus. Much like you we came into
Epicodus with a lot of hope & expectations, and like you will find out it takes
a lot of work to succeed while you're there. Two of the best things you can p
during your time at Epicodus is (drum roll please) understanding & practice.
