### [A Smarter Way To Learn Javascript](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B00H1W9I6C&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_5C7NJTNHAJAK9YQQV2J3) by Mark Myers   

This is an excellent book for those still warming up to Javascript. The chapters
cut right to the point of each concept they're exploring in a conversational
tone, and encourage coders to follow along with online exercises they provide. A
fellow Epicodus student has read through the book a few times and still finds
great value in it.

### [A Philosophy Of Software Design](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B07N1XLQ7D&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_WD8RZY262E7JB1ZQA0WX) by John Ousterhout

Written by a professor of computer science at Stanford, this one offers a fun
perspective as to what kinds of code are preferred in the coding world
(especially in regards to debugging). While it may not be as useful of a tool
during your time at Epicodus, it invites discussion among other coders (across
all coding languages) as to what makes good code good and preferred programming
styles. This one is a little dense, but a fun read if you're into that sort of
stuff.
