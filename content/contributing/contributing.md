We welcome anyone with an interest in contributing to {{ lhtlhtp() }} to please
do so. A community is nothing without the people putting in the work to build 
it. With that said please respect anyone you interact with, and do your best to
assume that everyone is approaching with the best intentions. This document
sets some guidelines to help keep things consistent across the site to make it
easier to contribute in the future.

## General Cleanup

- Spelling mistakes.
- Sentences that could be reworded to clarify.
- Replacing broken links.
- Adding links to relevant pieces of information.

## Content

- Content should be well written, and easily approachable. If you feel a section
  is becoming too long, or gets too technical, open a  discussion on the {{
  repo() }} and see if another set of eyes can help you break a section down, or
  give a different perspective to help a reader understand.
- Pages should not be too long to read. Anything past the 25 minute mark should
  be a red flag, and should definitely be reviewed to make sure it's all
  necessary, or if the content might be better split into different pages.
- Please only use secondary headers and below for your sections (Ex: ##, ###,
  ...)
- Wrap content on line 80 to make it easier to fit multiple windows side by side.
  Going a little over this is okay, but try not to do it too much. The only
  exception to this should be when using links. Link text & urls that are too
  long are okay to have past the limit, but please break as soon as possible after
  those.

### Images

- Images can be a great way to communicate information to someone, but can also
  add a lot of overhead to a site. Keep them to a minimum, and if they must be
  included do your best to pare them down as much as possible. SVG images are
  a great source for this.

### Videos

- Videos are a great way to leverage the knowledge and skill of others to help
  people understand our content. Please do not add too many videos to a page.
  Each section should be easily digestible, and focused on answering a specific
  question, or imparting a specific piece of knowledge.
- We will never host our own videos so it is always good to double check any
  video links to make sure they are still available, and that it's from a
  reputable source.

## Styling

- Unless there is a specific need to change the styling we've done our best to
  style the site in a set it & forget it way.

## Structure & Goals

- Discussing the structure and goals of the site is always welcome, but please
  be prepared for a discussion to not have an immediate resolution. Dialogue is
  always valued!
- Please do not change anything to radically alter the structure or layout of
  the site without discussion first. Doing so will likely result in an immediate
  rejection of your PR.
