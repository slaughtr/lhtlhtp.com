## The Long Version

See the [contributing section](https://lhtlhtp.com/contributing/built/) on
*lhtlhtp.com*. The site itself includes instructions for how to contribute to
it. You can also take a look at the `contributing` directory located under
`content` in the repo and read the Markdown files directly.

## TL;DR

- Install [Zola](https://getzola.org/)
- Clone this repo
- In the top level directory of the cloned repo open a live edit version of the
  site with `zola serve`
- Make changes and watch the site refresh in real time
- Finalize changes and make a pull request
- Bask in the glory of having helped contribute.
